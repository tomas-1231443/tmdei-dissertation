   abstract = {Since the introduction of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) around 15 years ago, their importance has grown significantly, especially over the last five years. This is mainly due to the paramount necessity to prevent major cyber incidents and the resulting adoption of centralized security operations in businesses. Despite their popularity, existing academic work on the topic lacks a generally accepted view and focuses mainly on fragments rather than looking at it holistically. These shortcomings impede further innovation. In this paper, a comprehensive literature survey is conducted to collate different views. The discovered literature is then used to determine the current state-of-the-art of SOCs and derive primary building blocks. Current challenges within a SOC are identified and summarized. A notable shortcoming of academic research is its focus on the human and technological aspects of a SOC while neglecting the connection of these two areas by specific processes (especially by non-technical processes). However, this area is essential for leveraging the full potential of a SOC in the future.},

   abstract = {Cybersecurity data remains a challenge for the machine learning community as the high volume of traffic makes it difficult to properly disambiguate anomalous from normal behaviour. That decision is the core of an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a component responsible for raising alerts whenever a potential threat is detected. However, with high volume data in contemporary systems, these IDSs generate numerous alerts, too large for human operators to exhaustively investigate. Moreover, simply reporting a single possible threat is often not sufficient, since the security analyst has to investigate the alert without any further clues of the underlying cause. In order to combat these issues, we empirically compare popular deep neural learning architectures for the problem of intrusion detection in sequential data streams. Contrary to a majority of research studies, we do not take a classification-based approach that requires labeled examples of hostile attacks. Instead, we adopt an unsupervised anomaly detection approach that aims to model a benign sequential data distribution against which new test instances are compared to. We also examine one additional deep network in the form of an attention model capable of providing explanations in addition to its predictions; such information is of crucial importance to network operators since it provides additional guidance to resolve potential threats. For our experiments, we evaluate the models against a variety of data sets of different complexities, ranging from simple unidimensional (synthetic and Yahoo!) to more complex multi-source (CICIDS2017 and small real-world enterprise network) data streams. In order to facilitate end-user needs, we focus on ranking-based metrics for comparing different deep neural architectures. This evaluation is especially important for security analysts to prioritize their anomaly investigations. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that a variant of a recurrent neural network generally outperforms a popular non-sequential deep autoencoder commonly used for unsupervised anomaly detection. The attentional model did not provide sufficiently good performance and explanations that we discuss in our analysis. Nonetheless, given that the global financial outlays for cybersecurity are calculated in trillions of dollars, our evaluation and identification of the top-performing RNN architectures for anomaly detection in sequential data streams can lead to improved intelligent IDS design, while our contributions of attentional explanation will hopefully lay the foundations for future improvements to the explanatory capability of these intelligent learning-based IDSs.}

SOCs are central defense groups that focus on security incident management with capabilities such as monitoring, preventing, responding, and reporting. They are one of the most critical defense components of a modern organization's defense. Despite their critical importance to organizations, and the high frequency of reported security incidents, only a few research studies focus on problems specific to SOCs. In this study, to understand and identify the issues of SOCs, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers who work for organizations from different industry sectors. Through our analysis of the interview data, we identified technical and non-technical issues that exist in SOC. Moreover, we found inherent disagreements between SOC managers and their analysts that, if not addressed, could entail a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these issues into takeaways that apply both to future academic research and to SOC management. We believe that research should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs.},

   abstract = {Security researchers have been trying to understand functioning of a security operation center (SOC) and how security analysts perform their job. This effort is motivated by the fact that security monitoring and analysis is not just a technical problem. Researchers must take into consideration the human and organizational factors for their research ideas to succeed. Much work towards this direction has been through interviews of security analysts in SOCs. Interviews, however useful, will not be always possible as analysts work in a high-stress and time constrained environment. Thus the understanding of operational challenges through interviews is quite shallow. There is also an issue of trust that limits the amount of information an analyst shares with an interviewing researcher. In our work, we take an anthropological approach to address this problem. Students with Computer Science background get trained in anthropological methods by an anthropologist and are embedded as security analysts in operation centers. Embedded students perform the same job as an analyst and see the operational world from the view point of an analyst. Through reection on the observations made by the students we gain a holistic perspective of the challenges in operation centers. In this paper we report preliminary results on the ongoing fieldwork at two corporate and a University SOC.},

   abstract = {Triage analysis is a fundamental stage in cyber operations in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). The massive data sources generate great demands on cyber security analysts' capability of information processing and analytical reasoning. Furthermore, mostjunior security analysts perform much less efficiently than senior analysts in deciding what data triage operations to perform. To help analysts perform better, retrieval methods need to be proposed to facilitate data triaging through retrieval of the relevant historical data triage operations of senior security analysts. This thesis conducts a research of retrieval methods based on recurrent neural network, including rule-based retrieval and context-based retrieval of data triage operations. It further discusses the new directions in solving the data triage operation retrieval problem. The present situation is that most novice analysts who are responsible for performing data triage tasks suffer a great deal from the complexity and intensity of their tasks. To fill the gap, we propose to provide novice analysts with on-the-job suggestions by presenting the relevant data triage operations conducted by senior analysts in a previous task. A tracing method has been developed to track an analyst's data triage operations. This thesis mainly presents a data triage operation retrieval system that (1) models the context of a data triage analytic process, (2) uses recurrent neural network to compare matching contexts, and (3) presents the matched traces to the novice analysts as suggestions. We have implemented and evaluated the performance of the system through both automated testing and human evaluation. The results show that the proposed retrieval system can effectively identify the relevant traces based on an analyst's current analytic process.},

Security information and event management (SIEM) systems in tandem with security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) systems are an integral part of a security operation center (SOC) because this not only further helps organizations gain a holistic view of their security status but also protects their IT infrastructure.

   abstract = {This paper explores three fundamental machine learning techniques—linear regression, k-means clustering, and decision trees—and their applications in predictive modeling. In the era of data proliferation, machine learning stands at the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence, playing a pivotal role in algorithm and model development for enhanced predictions and decision-making. The study delves into the intricacies of these techniques, starting with a focus on linear regression, a supervised learning algorithm for establishing relationships between independent and dependent variables. The process involves data preparation, exploration, feature selection, model building, and evaluation. A practical example demonstrates the application of linear regression in analyzing the relationship between income and happiness. The exploration then extends to k-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm used for grouping unlabeled datasets into distinct clusters. The iterative nature of k-means involves assigning data points to clusters based on centroid proximity, contributing to efficient data exploration. A graphical representation illustrates the step-by-step process of data point grouping and centroid recalibration. The advantages of k-means, including computational efficiency and simplicity, are discussed, along with considerations such as sensitivity to initialization and the manual specification of the number of clusters. The paper concludes with an examination of decision trees, versatile algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision trees construct hierarchical structures based on features, facilitating straightforward decision-making processes. A practical example illustrates how decision trees assess credit risk based on credit history and loan term. The strengths of decision trees, such as visual representation and non-linear pattern capture, are outlined, alongside considerations like overfitting. In summary, this paper provides insights into the strengths, limitations, and applications of linear regression, k-means clustering, and decision trees. These techniques offer valuable tools in data analysis and prediction, with their effectiveness dependent on specific problem domains and datasets. The study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of these machine learning methods and suggests future research directions, including exploring advanced variations and real-world applications.},
